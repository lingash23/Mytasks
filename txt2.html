       <h1> Objects in Javascript </h1>
        <p>
            Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
            These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, 
            and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
        </p>
        
        <h1>JavaScript Object Properties</h1>
        <p>
            The property names can be strings or numbers. In case the property names are numbers, 
            they must be accessed using the “bracket notation” like this.
        </p>
        <h1> Internal Representation of Objects </h1>
        <p>
            Internally, JavaScript engines use various data structures to represent objects efficiently. 
            One common approach is using a hash table or a similar structure to store the object’s properties and their 
            corresponding values. This allows for fast access and manipulation of properties.
